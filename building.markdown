<h1>Parking</h1>
<p> Merritt House parking lot is for residents and their guests. Parking spaces are designated as white dashes on the lot. The first two spaces at the Front Foyer are reserved for two residents who require easy access to the entrance. Parking in front of the shed is not permitted during weekdays in order to allow trash pickup and maintenance truck parking. During the winter, residents will be asked via email or text to move their vehicle(s) from one side of the parking lot to the other to allow for snow plowing when needed - see Snow Plowing paragraph. Seasonal winter parking is the Northeast corner of the lot. Vehicles will not be moved for snow plowing so plan accordingly. Please coordinate with a year round board member resident to leave behind vehicle keys in the event the vehicle does need to be moved.  Boat trailers are permitted at the North end of the parking lot twice a year for launching and retrieving boats. Parking for RVs, cargo trailers, or other such vehicles is strongly discouraged. Please contact the Board President if an exception is requested.  </p>
<h1>Snow Plowing</h1>
<p> Snow removal is completed in two plowing sessions. When snow falls occur, please coordinate with other residents to park on one side of the lot. After the first 'half' of the lot is cleared, then move your vehicles to the other side for removal of the remaining snow. </p>
