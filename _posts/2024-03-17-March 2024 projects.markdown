<p> The first project for the reconstruction of the porch of unit G1 has begun.   </p>

<p>March 31st - G1's porch has been demolished, structural wood rot has been removed. Treated wood was used for the new framing.  Debris in the crawlspace has been removed. A solid concrete wall was added at the crawlspace underneath the porch with a door for crawlspace access - this should definitely keep out the raccoons. Next phase will be replacing the decking, the stairs to the porch, and the encapsulation of the crawlspace with a sump pump and spray foam insulation.
</p>

<p> March 11th - The porch has been demolished and they are now tackling some of the structural wood rot that remains. Mason will be here at the end of the week to begin the wall.</p>
