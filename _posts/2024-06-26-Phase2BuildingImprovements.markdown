<p><h1>	First the Drainage aspect: </h1> </p> <p>Older pipes were dug up
and trenches were expanded both in width and depth. Blue rubber sheeting was placed alongside the building and inside the trenches as a
barrier against water seeping into the foundation. New solid pipe was installed connecting all the gutter downspouts to flow the water away
from the building. Perforated pipes were also added to allow runoff from the road and neighbors to seep through the ground and avoid the
building. New rock was spread to bury the pipes and widen the walkability of the trenches as well as create small cesspools at the end of the
pipes to further channel water away from the building. Mulch was added to the flower beds and top soil was added to the back, swaled
downwards to the road away from the building. All of the top soil area was hydro-seeded with grass seed to provide a wide grass walkway (not
driveway) for us to enjoy. Drainage is now complete thanks to RA Webber’s crew.
