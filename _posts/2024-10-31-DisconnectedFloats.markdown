<h2> Disconnected Floats Checked/Verified For Safe Distance From Ledge.  </h2>

* Low tide was 5:24 pm this evening. Verified that the lines from the deep water dock arch posts to the eastern cleats of the long float were properly slack and that north/south mooring lines slacked earlier today were still keeping the 3 floats a safe distance from the ledge at the end of the deep water dock. All is ok.  Tomorrow at high tide Corey Theberge will be able to pull in the floats via the two lines to hop down onto the long float from the end of the gangway and ferry each float in turn over to the crane. *
