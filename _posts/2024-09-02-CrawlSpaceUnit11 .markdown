 <p> These before pictures show lots of construction debris, wet conditions, uneven posts that had to be addressed before TC Hafford could encapsulate this space to mitigate water and humidity.

<p><h1>	Original Structural : </h1> </p>
<p>Joist hangers connect the floor
joists to the interior rim joist. The rim joist against the concrete wall is pressure treated (below photo).
Fastening between the pressure treated rim joist and the concrete wall is unknown as it is concealed
by the interior rim joist ply. There appear to be occasional nails installed between the two rim joist
plies.</p>

<p>At some locations at the exterior footing, extensive wicking of moisture up the PT post through the
end grain.</p>

<p>At other locations, cedar shingle shims between the top of the 4x6
PT post and bottom of the two rim joists are crushed and broken.</p>

<p>Like the exterior foundation wall, moisture is wicking up the wood posts below the center beam.
Where the center floor beam is in contact with the concrete foundation, moisture is wicking into its
end grain as well.</p>

<br>


<p>At other locations below the center beam, the supporting posts are
crushing the bottom of the beam. This implies beam and support posts are very heavily
loaded. Given that the center beam is likely supporting five floors and the roof, it is not unexpected
that there is evidence of beam bearing issues given the small bearing area provided by the supporting
posts.</p>
