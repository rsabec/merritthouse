<p><h1> The “Diver Down” flag that we will use as a swim flag is now attached to the ramp railing</h1></p>

<p>The Swim Flag is in the PVC tube attached to the north side of the end of the ramp middle rail.

<br>
<p>Remove the black cap closet to the bottom of the ramp to access the flag.  Carefully remove the flag from the tube and replace the cap. The cap is attached to a lanyard to prevent loss.</p>

<p>Place the flag anytime someone is swimming to alert nearby boats, kayaks, etc. that someone is in the water, into the drilled hole in the top of the north west post. Tighten and knot the red line to the black cleat below. </p>

<br>
<p>The flag has a stiffening wire to hold it out straight regardless of wind or no wind. Try to position the flag so that it is facing generally north west over the water for greatest visibility of boaters.</p>

<p>Tying the red line down to prevent the wind from lifting the flag out of the hole and blowing away is best done using a “cleat hitch” knot. I would be happy to show anyone who does know how to do this.

<p>When done swimming and returning the flag to it’s storage tube, gently circle your hand around the bottom of the flag and move your hand up until the flag folds shut the carefully put it back into the tube and replace the black cap. </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Thank You,</p>
