<p> The new kayak roller discussed during the Merritt House Annual Meeting has been installed to the immediate left of the swim ladder and is protected from landing boats with the addition of a third vertical hard fender. The spacing between the 2 fenders on either side of the kayak roller is 40” which is compatible with both the widest commercially made kayaks and canoes.  The roller as shown in this picture is in its locked-down position for use to launch or retrieve. </p>

<p>The Kayak roller is bolted onto a hinged PT 2x12 block. The hinges and the front locking clasp are marine-grade stainless steel normally used on boat cockpit lockers. I need to pick up a SS cotter pin for the front clasp to prevent unintended release. All of the mounting H/W is SS. This block will be removed like the ladder prior to off-season storage to prevent damage.</p>

<p>This picture shows the front clasp in the closed “locked” position.  I need to acquire and add a cotter pin on a lanyard to allow full locking in the down position.</p>

<p>Same side view of the Kayak roller in the hinged stowed position when not in use. The block is tensioned by a zip-tied shock cord to be held in this position when not in use.  Simply hold the middle of the roller and push it forward and engage the front clasp to move to the use-position. The shock cord stretches to accommodate this.

<p>Having the Kayak roller on this hinged block allows the roller in the stowed position to grant full clearance of any landing boat with a flared out topside, however all landing boats should be careful not to block either the Kayak roller our the swim ladder. The new 3rd vertical hard fender to the left of the Kayak roller marks the north-most hard boundary.  Swimmers and kayakers need unrestricted access, please do not block.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>
