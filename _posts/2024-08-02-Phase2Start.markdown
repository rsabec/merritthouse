<p><h1>	Phase 2 Unit 11 Crawl Space Project has begun: </h1> </p> <p> The work will continue thru the first week of September and may be a bit noisy at times. Several parking spaces on the East side of the parking lot will be blocked off during the week to allow easier access for materials to the crawl space via the window.. 
</p>
<p><h1>Parking for next several weeks: </h1></p> 
<p> If guests are staying here in the coming weeks, please let them know that cars should be moved to the West side of the parking lot on Sunday evenings. And as always, the first 2 spots at the Main Entrance are for our residents who need closer access to the door.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience during this phase of our repairs.</p>
