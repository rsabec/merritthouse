<p>The original 1898 'Merritt House' was re-built in 2009 and sold as 12 individual condominuium units.  An entire new wing was added to the back of the building to add 4 of the additional units and was completed as a 5 story wood frame structure ( not including the ground floor unit ). The original advertisement shown below and boasts of the rights to the adjacent 'deep water dock facility float and a private mooring for <b>each</b> unit'</p>
